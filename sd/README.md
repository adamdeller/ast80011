# SD

scripts useful for analysis and/or plotting of data for the SD module

Currently, it contains a number of scripts for prettier plotting, as well as a tool to allow simulations to pick up where another one ended.

Each script should be more (or less!) self-documenting: if you have questions, please ask on the AST80011 discussion forums or raise an issue here on github.
