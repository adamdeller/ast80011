# GI

scripts useful for analysis and/or plotting of data for the GI module

Currently, it contains two subdirectories - one (batchrunner) contains scripts for command-line execution of jobs, making it easier to launch larger numbers 
of jobs and to programmatically modify parameters.  The second (statisticalanalysis) provides some post-processing and plotting capabilities to analyse the 
projected particles at the end of a job.
